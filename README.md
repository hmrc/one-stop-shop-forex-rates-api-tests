# one-stop-shop-forex-rates-api-tests
API test suite for the `one-stop-shop-forex-rates` service using ScalaTest and [play-ws](https://github.com/playframework/play-ws) client.

## Running the tests

Prior to executing the tests ensure you have:
- Installed [MongoDB](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/installation/)
- Installed/configured [service manager](https://github.com/hmrc/service-manager).

Run the following commands to start services locally:

MongoDB:

Run at least 4.0 with a replica set: `docker run --restart unless-stopped -d -p 27017-27019:27017-27019 --name mongo4 mongo:4.0 --replSet rs0`
Connect to said replica set: `docker exec -it mongo4 mongo`
When that console is there: `rs.initiate()`
You then should be running 4.0 with a replica set. You may have to re-run the rs.initiate() after you've restarted


Service Manager:
```
sm --start ONE_STOP_SHOP_ALL -r
```
If running a branch of one-stop-shop-forex-rates locally, use the following command in the terminal:
```
"sbt run -Dapplication.router=testOnlyDoNotUseInAppConf.Routes"
```

Then execute the `run_tests.sh` script:

`./run_tests.sh <environment>`

The tests default to the `local` environment.  For a complete list of supported param values, see:
- `src/test/resources/application.conf` for **environment**

#### Running the tests against a test environment

To run the tests against an environment set the corresponding `host` environment property as specified under
`<env>.host.services` in the [application.conf](src/test/resources/application.conf).
